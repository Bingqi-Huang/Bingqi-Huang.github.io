I am a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at Tsinghua University, starting in August 2025. My research interests include Mobile Manipulation and Human-Robot Interaction.

I received my Bachelor's degree from Xingjian College, Tsinghua University, where I majored in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics & Aerospace Engineering. I was also an exchange student in Robotics at Delft University of Technology from Sept 2023 to Feb 2024. I did some interesting summer intership at Ericsson doing some FEA for their antennas.
